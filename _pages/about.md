I'm a Masters Student at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu), advised by Prof. [Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me) and Prof. [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Machanical Engineering at [Xingjian College](https://www.xjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/About.htm) of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), advised by Prof. [Shengbo Li](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/dpeople.html?11). I also worked at [MSCLab](https://msc.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley as a research intern, advised by Prof. [Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/).

I am interested in reinforcement learning for robotics that not to solve continuous control problems, but improving intellegence for foundation models. I worked on sample-effecient MBRL and real-world RL for VLA self-improvement, I also worked on behavior modeling in autonomous driving. 

I also love photographyüì∏ and travellingtravelling‚úàÔ∏è, checkout my [Unsplash profile](https://unsplash.com/@darth_u).
